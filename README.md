puppet-zoneminder
=================

## Overview
A puppet module to completely install ZoneMinder 1.25.0 from source.
The ZoneMinder source is patched with mastertheknife's performance patch, and nextime's plugin architecture patch, including his licence plate and facial recognition plugins.

## How to use - Read Me First!
This module is designed to be used with a standalone puppet master, or with a puppet solo install.  If you are already using puppet and have declared mysql, apache, or any of the other prerequisites defined in zoneminder::params, this module will fail to run due to resource declaration issues.

### Puppet Solo
In this case, you'll want to do the following steps on a clean box on which you want ZoneMinder to be installed.

 1.  Install a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 server.  I went with a minimal install, but a normal install should work.
 2.  Set up network, SSH, whatever else.
 3.  apt-get update && apt-get install puppet git-core
 4.  git clone git://github.com/kylejohnson/puppet-zoneminder.git zoneminder
 5.  sudo puppet apply --verbose -e 'include zoneminder'
 6.  Pray.  Just kidding.  But seriously.  If something breaks, please report it to me (refer to the Troubleshooting / Getting Support section below)

## Platforms
 * Ubuntu 12.04

## Troubleshooting / Getting Support
 * I'm in #dspam on irc.freenode.net as fixxxermet.  Feel free to drop by and ask for help!

## Issues
 * Should I install ffmpeg from source, or from the package repo?  Does the repo version of ffmpeg even work?
     * From source is working
 * Need to add checks for Ubuntu.  This will probably fail misserably on ! Ubuntu
 * Should I use fastcgi and nginx?
 * I should move the different install sections to subclasses (what are they called again?)
     * Moved them to separate classes.  Much cleaner this way.
 * I should move the libjpeg deb to module, so it doesn't rely on a mirror
     * Moved to the libjpeg-turbo8 and libjpeg-turbo8-dev patches
 * Need to setup a config::database class and config::apache class before this module can be called complete.
 * You will want to manually create a mysql root password after running this module, as the mysql root user does not have a password by default.
